				<v id="1" bcv="TIT.1.1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</v>
				<v id="2" bcv="TIT.1.2">in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;</v>
				<v id="3" bcv="TIT.1.3">but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;</v>
				<v id="4" bcv="TIT.1.4">to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</v>
				<v id="5" bcv="TIT.1.5">I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you,</v>
				<v id="6" bcv="TIT.1.6">if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</v>
				<v id="7" bcv="TIT.1.7">For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</v>
				<v id="8" bcv="TIT.1.8">but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled,</v>
				<v id="9" bcv="TIT.1.9">holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</v>
				<v id="10" bcv="TIT.1.10">For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</v>
				<v id="11" bcv="TIT.1.11">whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.</v>
				<v id="12" bcv="TIT.1.12">One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”</v>
				<v id="13" bcv="TIT.1.13">This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</v>
				<v id="14" bcv="TIT.1.14">not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</v>
				<v id="15" bcv="TIT.1.15">To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</v>
				<v id="16" bcv="TIT.1.16">They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</v>
			</c>
			<c id="2">
				<v id="1" bcv="TIT.2.1">But say the things which fit sound doctrine,</v>
				<v id="2" bcv="TIT.2.2">that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance:</v>
				<v id="3" bcv="TIT.2.3">and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good,</v>
				<v id="4" bcv="TIT.2.4">that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children,</v>
				<v id="5" bcv="TIT.2.5">to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.</v>
				<v id="6" bcv="TIT.2.6">Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded.</v>
				<v id="7" bcv="TIT.2.7">In all things be showing yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, be showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,</v>
				<v id="8" bcv="TIT.2.8">and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</v>
				<v id="9" bcv="TIT.2.9">Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting,</v>
				<v id="10" bcv="TIT.2.10">not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.</v>
				<v id="11" bcv="TIT.2.11">For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</v>
				<v id="12" bcv="TIT.2.12">instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;</v>
				<v id="13" bcv="TIT.2.13">looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,</v>
				<v id="14" bcv="TIT.2.14">who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</v>
				<v id="15" bcv="TIT.2.15">Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.</v>
			</c>
			<c id="3">
				<v id="1" bcv="TIT.3.1">Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</v>
				<v id="2" bcv="TIT.3.2">to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</v>
				<v id="3" bcv="TIT.3.3">For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</v>
				<v id="4" bcv="TIT.3.4">But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</v>
				<v id="5" bcv="TIT.3.5">not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</v>
				<v id="6" bcv="TIT.3.6">whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</v>
				<v id="7" bcv="TIT.3.7">that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</v>
				<v id="8" bcv="TIT.3.8">This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</v>
				<v id="9" bcv="TIT.3.9">but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</v>
				<v id="10" bcv="TIT.3.10">Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,</v>
				<v id="11" bcv="TIT.3.11">knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.</v>
				<v id="12" bcv="TIT.3.12">When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</v>
				<v id="13" bcv="TIT.3.13">Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</v>
				<v id="14" bcv="TIT.3.14">Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</v>
				<v id="15" bcv="TIT.3.15">All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</v>

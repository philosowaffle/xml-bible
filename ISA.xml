			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.1.1">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.1.2">Hear, heavens,and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:“I have nourished and brought up children,and they have rebelled against me.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.1.3">The ox knows his owner,and the donkey his master’s crib;but Israel doesn’t know,my people don’t consider.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.1.4">Ah sinful nation,a people loaded with iniquity,offspring of evildoers,children who deal corruptly!They have forsaken Yahweh. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged and backward.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.1.5">Why should you be beaten more,that you revolt more and more?The whole head is sick,and the whole heart faint.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.1.6">From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it:wounds, welts, and open sores. They haven’t been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.1.7">Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Strangers devour your land in your presence,and it is desolate,as overthrown by strangers.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.1.8">The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,like a hut in a field of melons,like a besieged city.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.1.9">Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,we would have been as Sodom;we would have been like Gomorrah.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.1.10">Hear Yahweh’s word, you rulers of Sodom!Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.1.11">“What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”, says Yahweh. “I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams,and the fat of fed animals. I don’t delight in the blood of bulls,or of lambs,or of male goats.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.1.12">When you come to appear before me,who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.1.13">Bring no more vain offerings. Incense is an abomination to me;new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:I can’t stand evil assemblies.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.1.14">My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to me. I am weary of bearing them.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.1.15">When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.1.16">Wash yourselves, make yourself clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.1.17">Learn to do well. Seek justice. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow.”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.1.18">“Come now, and let’s reason together,” says Yahweh:“Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.1.19">If you are willing and obedient,you shall eat the good of the land;</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.1.20">but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.”</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.1.21">How the faithful city has become a prostitute!She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her,but now murderers.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.1.22">Your silver has become dross,your wine mixed with water.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="ISA.1.23">Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They don’t judge the fatherless,neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="ISA.1.24">Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,the Mighty One of Israel, says:“Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,and avenge myself on my enemies;</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="ISA.1.25">and I will turn my hand on you,thoroughly purge away your dross,and will take away all your tin.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="ISA.1.26">I will restore your judges as at the first,and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness,a faithful town.’</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="ISA.1.27">Zion shall be redeemed with justice,and her converts with righteousness.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="ISA.1.28">But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="ISA.1.29">For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="ISA.1.30">For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,and as a garden that has no water.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="ISA.1.31">The strong will be like tinder,and his work like a spark. They will both burn together,and no one will quench them.”</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.2.1">This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.2.2">It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains,and shall be raised above the hills;and all nations shall flow to it.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.2.3">Many peoples shall go and say,“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,to the house of the God of Jacob;and he will teach us of his ways,and we will walk in his paths.”For out of Zion the law shall go out,and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.2.4">He will judge between the nations,and will decide concerning many peoples;and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,neither shall they learn war any more.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.2.5">House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.2.6">For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,because they are filled from the east,with those who practice divination like the Philistines,and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.2.7">Their land is full of silver and gold,neither is there any end of their treasures. Their land also is full of horses,neither is there any end of their chariots.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.2.8">Their land also is full of idols. They worship the work of their own hands,that which their own fingers have made.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.2.9">Man is brought low,and mankind is humbled;therefore don’t forgive them.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.2.10">Enter into the rock,and hide in the dust,from before the terror of Yahweh,and from the glory of his majesty.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.2.11">The lofty looks of man will be brought low,the arrogance of men will be bowed down,and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.2.12">For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and arrogant,and for all that is lifted up;and it shall be brought low:</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.2.13">For all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,for all the oaks of Bashan,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.2.14">For all the high mountains,for all the hills that are lifted up,</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.2.15">For every lofty tower,for every fortified wall,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.2.16">For all the ships of Tarshish,and for all pleasant imagery.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.2.17">The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,and the arrogance of men shall be brought low;and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.2.18">The idols shall utterly pass away.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.2.19">Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,and into the holes of the earth,from before the terror of Yahweh,and from the glory of his majesty,when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.2.20">In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver,and their idols of gold,which have been made for themselves to worship,to the moles and to the bats;</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.2.21">To go into the caverns of the rocks,and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,from before the terror of Yahweh,and from the glory of his majesty,when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.2.22">Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;for of what account is he?</v>
		</c>
		<c id="3">
			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.3.1">For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support,the whole supply of bread,and the whole supply of water;</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.3.2">the mighty man,the man of war,the judge,the prophet,the diviner,the elder,</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.3.3">the captain of fifty,the honorable man,the counselor,the skilled craftsman,and the clever enchanter.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.3.4">I will give boys to be their princes,and children shall rule over them.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.3.5">The people will be oppressed,everyone by another,and everyone by his neighbor. The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,and the wicked against the honorable.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.3.6">Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,“You have clothing, you be our ruler,and let this ruin be under your hand.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.3.7">In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer;for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. You shall not make me ruler of the people.”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.3.8">For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen;because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh,to provoke the eyes of his glory.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.3.9">The look of their faces testify against them. They parade their sin like Sodom. They don’t hide it. Woe to their soul!For they have brought disaster upon themselves.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.3.10">Tell the righteous “Good!”For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.3.11">Woe to the wicked!Disaster is upon them;for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.3.12">As for my people, children are their oppressors,and women rule over them. My people, those who lead you cause you to err,and destroy the way of your paths.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.3.13">Yahweh stands up to contend,and stands to judge the peoples.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.3.14">Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people,and their leaders:“It is you who have eaten up the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.3.15">What do you mean that you crush my people,and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.3.16">Moreover Yahweh said, “Because the daughters of Zion are arrogant,and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,walking to trip as they go,jingling ornaments on their feet;</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.3.17">therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.3.18">In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.3.19">the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.3.20">the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume containers, the charms,</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.3.21">the signet rings, the nose rings,</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.3.22">the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="ISA.3.23">the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="ISA.3.24">It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;instead of a belt, a rope;instead of well set hair, baldness;instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;and branding instead of beauty.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="ISA.3.25">Your men shall fall by the sword,and your mighty in the war.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="ISA.3.26">Her gates shall lament and mourn;and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="4">
			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.4.1">Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach.”</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.4.2">In that day, Yahweh’s branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.4.3">It will happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem;</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.4.4">when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from within it, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.4.5">Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.4.6">There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="5">
			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.5.1">Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.5.2">He dug it up,gathered out its stones,planted it with the choicest vine,built a tower in the middle of it,and also cut out a wine press therein. He looked for it to yield grapes,but it yielded wild grapes.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.5.3">“Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,please judge between me and my vineyard.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.5.4">What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.5.5">Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up. I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.5.6">I will lay it a wasteland. It won’t be pruned nor hoed,but it will grow briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.5.7">For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression;for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.5.8">Woe to those who join house to house,who lay field to field, until there is no room,and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.5.9">In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says: “Surely many houses will be desolate,even great and beautiful, unoccupied.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.5.10">For ten acresand a homer</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.5.11">Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink;who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.5.12">The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;but they don’t respect the work of Yahweh,neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.5.13">Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge. Their honorable men are famished,and their multitudes are parched with thirst.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.5.14">Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire,and opened its mouth without measure;and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.5.15">So man is brought low,mankind is humbled,and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.5.16">but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice,and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.5.17">Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.5.18">Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,and wickedness as with cart rope;</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.5.19">Who say, “Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,that we may know it!”</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.5.20">Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;who put darkness for light,and light for darkness;who put bitter for sweet,and sweet for bitter!</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.5.21">Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,and prudent in their own sight!</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.5.22">Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,and champions at mixing strong drink;</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="ISA.5.23">who acquit the guilty for a bribe,but deny justice for the innocent!</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="ISA.5.24">Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,so their root shall be as rottenness,and their blossom shall go up as dust;because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="ISA.5.25">Therefore Yahweh’s anger burns against his people,and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them. The mountains tremble,and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets. For all this, his anger is not turned away,but his hand is still stretched out.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="ISA.5.26">He will lift up a banner to the nations from far,and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth. Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="ISA.5.27">No one shall be weary nor stumble among them;no one shall slumber nor sleep;neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,nor the strap of their sandals be broken:</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="ISA.5.28">whose arrows are sharp,and all their bows bent. Their horses’ hoofs will be like flint,and their wheels like a whirlwind.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="ISA.5.29">Their roaring will be like a lioness. They will roar like young lions. Yes, they shall roar,and seize their prey and carry it off,and there will be no one to deliver.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="ISA.5.30">They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress. The light is darkened in its clouds.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.6.1">In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.6.2">Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.6.3">One called to another, and said,“Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!The whole earth is full of his glory!”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.6.4">The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.6.5">Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!”</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.6.6">Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.6.7">He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.6.8">I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.6.9">He said, “Go, and tell this people,‘You hear indeed,but don’t understand;and you see indeed,but don’t perceive.’</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.6.10">Make the heart of this people fat. Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;lest they see with their eyes,and hear with their ears,and understand with their heart,and turn again, and be healed.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.6.11">Then I said, “Lord, how long?”He answered,“Until cities are waste without inhabitant,and houses without man,and the land becomes utterly waste,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.6.12">And Yahweh has removed men far away,and the forsaken places are many within the land.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.6.13">If there is a tenth left in it,that also will in turn be consumed:as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled;so the holy seed is its stock.”</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.7.1">In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.7.2">David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.7.3">Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.7.4">Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.7.5">Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying,</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.7.6">“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.7.7">This is what the Lord Yahweh says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.7.8">For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people;</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.7.9">and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’”</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.7.10">Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.7.11">“Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.7.12">But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt Yahweh.”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.7.13">He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also?</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.7.14">Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.7.15">He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.7.16">For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.7.17">Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.7.18">It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.7.19">They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.7.20">In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.7.21">It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.7.22">and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left within the land.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="ISA.7.23">It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels, shall be for briers and thorns.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="ISA.7.24">People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="ISA.7.25">All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.”</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.8.1">Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’;</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.8.3">I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.8.4">For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.”</v>

			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.8.8">It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, Immanuel.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.8.9">Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered!</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.8.10">Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand: for God is with us.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.8.11">For Yahweh spoke this to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.8.12">“Don’t say, ‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say, ‘A conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.8.13">Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.8.14">He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stumbling stone and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare.</v>

			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.8.16">Wrap up the covenant. Seal the law among my disciples.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.8.17">I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.8.18">Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.8.19">When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:” shouldn’t a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?</v>

			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.8.21">They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward,</v>

			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.9.2">The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light has shined.</v>

			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.9.17">Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;for everyone is profane and an evildoer,and every mouth speaks folly.

			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.10.12">Therefore it will happen that, when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his arrogant looks.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.10.13">For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.</v>

			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.10.15">Should an ax brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.10.16">Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire.</v>

			<v id="24" bcv="ISA.10.24">Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Egypt did.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.25.3">Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.25.4">For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.25.5">As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.25.6">In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of choice meat, a feast of choice wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.25.7">He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.25.8">He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken it.</v>

			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.26.4">Trust in Yahweh forever;for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.</v>

			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.27.10">For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.27.11">When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.27.12">It will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.27.13">It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</v>

			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.28.4">The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it.</v>

			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.28.9">Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.28.10">For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.28.11">But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language;</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.28.12">to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to weary;” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear.</v>

			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.28.14">Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem:</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.28.15">“Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we in agreement. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’”</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.28.16">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.28.17">I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.28.18">Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.28.19">As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.”</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.28.20">For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.28.21">For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.28.22">Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the whole earth.</v>

			<v id="24" bcv="ISA.28.24">Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="ISA.28.25">When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="ISA.28.26">For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="ISA.28.27">For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.</v>

			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.29.4">You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.29.5">But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.</v>

The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.36.1">Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah, and captured them.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.36.2">The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.36.3">Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.36.4">Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What confidence is this in which you trust?</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.36.5">I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.36.6">Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.36.7">But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar?’”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.36.8">Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.36.9">How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.36.10">Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.”’”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.36.11">Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.36.12">But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.36.13">Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.36.14">Thus says the king, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.36.15">Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us. This city won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.36.16">Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.36.17">until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.36.18">Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.” Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.36.19">Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.36.20">Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.36.21">But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.36.22">Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="37">
			<v id="1" bcv="ISA.37.1">When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh’s house.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.37.2">He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.37.3">They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to give birth.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.37.4">It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.37.5">So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.37.6">Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="ISA.37.7">Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="ISA.37.8">So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="ISA.37.9">He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="ISA.37.10">“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="ISA.37.11">Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="ISA.37.12">Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="ISA.37.13">Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="ISA.37.14">Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="ISA.37.15">Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="ISA.37.16">“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.37.17">Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold. Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.37.18">Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land,</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.37.19">and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="ISA.37.20">Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, even you only.”</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="ISA.37.21">Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="ISA.37.22">this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him. The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="ISA.37.23">Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="ISA.37.24">By your servants, have you defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="ISA.37.25">I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.”</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="ISA.37.26">“‘Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them into ruinous heaps.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="ISA.37.27">Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like a field before its crop has grown.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="ISA.37.28">But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="ISA.37.29">Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="ISA.37.30">“‘This shall be the sign to you. You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from it; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="ISA.37.31">The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="ISA.37.32">For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.’</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="ISA.37.33">“Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="ISA.37.34">He will return the way that he came, and he won’t come to this city,’ says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="ISA.37.35">‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’”</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="ISA.37.36">Then Yahweh’s angel went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="ISA.37.37">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and stayed there.</v>
			<v id="38" bcv="ISA.37.38">As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.</v>

			<v id="2" bcv="ISA.38.2">Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.38.3">and said, “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Hezekiah wept bitterly.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.38.4">Then Yahweh’s word came to Isaiah, saying,</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.38.5">“Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.</v>

			<v id="17" bcv="ISA.38.17">Behold, for peace I had great anguish,but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;for you have cast all my sins behind your back.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="ISA.38.18">For Sheol can’t praise you. Death can’t celebrate you. Those who go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="ISA.38.19">The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do today. The father shall make known your truth to the children.</v>

There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="ISA.39.3">Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? Where did they come from to you?”Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="ISA.39.4">Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?”Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="ISA.39.5">Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="ISA.39.6">‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JER.1.1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.1.2">Yahweh’s word came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.1.3">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.1.4">Now Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.1.5">“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I sanctified you. I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.”</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.1.6">Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Behold, I don’t know how to speak; for I am a child.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.1.7">But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for you must go to whomever I send you, and you must say whatever I command you.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.1.8">Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.1.9">Then Yahweh stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth. Then Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.1.10">Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.1.11">Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.1.12">Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.1.13">Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?”I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.1.14">Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.1.15">For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh. “They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.1.16">I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,in that they have forsaken me,and have burned incense to other gods,and worshiped the works of their own hands.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.1.17">“You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.1.18">For, behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.1.19">They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you”, says Yahweh, “to rescue you.”</v>

		<c id="2">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.2.1">Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.2.2">“Go, and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says,“I remember for you the kindness of your youth,the love of your weddings;how you went after me in the wilderness,in a land that was not sown.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.2.3">Israel was holiness to Yahweh,the first fruits of his increase. All who devour him will be held guilty. Evil will come on them,”’ says Yahweh.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.2.4">Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel!</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.2.5">Yahweh says,“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,that they have gone far from me,and have walked after worthless vanity,and have become worthless?</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.2.6">They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,who led us through the wilderness,through a land of deserts and of pits,through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,through a land that no one passed through,and where no man lived?’</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.2.7">I brought you into a plentiful land,to eat its fruit and its goodness;but when you entered, you defiled my land,and made my heritage an abomination.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.2.8">The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’and those who handle the law didn’t know me. The rulers also transgressed against me,and the prophets prophesied by Baal,and followed things that do not profit.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.2.9">“Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh,“and I will contend with your children’s children.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.2.10">For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see;and send to Kedar, and consider diligently;and see if there has been such a thing.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.2.11">Has a nation changed its gods,which really are no gods?But my people have changed their glory for that which doesn’t profit.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.2.12">“Be astonished, you heavens, at this,and be horribly afraid. Be very desolate,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.2.13">“For my people have committed two evils:they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters,and cut out cisterns for themselves: broken cisterns that can’t hold water.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.2.14">Is Israel a slave?Is he born into slavery?Why has he become a captive?</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.2.15">The young lions have roared at him, and yelled. They have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.2.16">The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.2.17">“Haven’t you brought this on yourself,in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.2.18">Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor?Or why do you to go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.2.19">“Your own wickedness will correct you,and your backsliding will rebuke you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JER.2.20">“For long ago I broke off your yoke,and burst your bonds. You said, ‘I will not serve;’for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself,playing the prostitute.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JER.2.21">Yet I had planted you a noble vine,a pure and faithful seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JER.2.22">For though you wash yourself with lye,and use much soap,yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JER.2.23">“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled. I have not gone after the Baals’?See your way in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JER.2.24">a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving. When she is in heat, who can turn her away?All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JER.2.25">“Keep your feet from being bare,and your throat from thirst. But you said, ‘It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers,and I will go after them.’</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JER.2.26">As the thief is ashamed when he is found,so the house of Israel is ashamed:they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets;</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JER.2.27">who tell wood, ‘You are my father;’and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me:’for they have turned their back to me,and not their face;but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us.’</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JER.2.28">“But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble:for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="JER.2.29">“Why will you contend with me?You all have transgressed against me,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="JER.2.30">“I have struck your children in vain. They received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets,like a destroying lion.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="JER.2.31">Generation, consider Yahweh’s word. Have I been a wilderness to Israel?Or a land of thick darkness?Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose. We will come to you no more?’</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="JER.2.32">“Can a virgin forget her ornaments,or a bride her attire?Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="JER.2.33">How well you prepare your way to seek love!Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="JER.2.34">Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts. You didn’t find them breaking in;but it is because of all these things.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="JER.2.35">“Yet you said, ‘I am innocent. Surely his anger has turned away from me.’“Behold, I will judge you,because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="JER.2.36">Why do you go about so much to change your ways?You will be ashamed of Egypt also,as you were ashamed of Assyria.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="JER.2.37">You will also leave that place with your hands on your head;for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,and you won’t prosper with them.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="3">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.3.1">“They say, ‘If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and becomes another man’s, should he return to her again?’ Wouldn’t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.3.2">“Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat waiting for them by the road, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.3.3">Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no latter rain; yet you have had a prostitute’s forehead and you refused to be ashamed.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.3.4">Will you not from this time cry to me, ‘My Father, you are the guide of my youth?’</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.3.5">“‘Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.”</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.3.6">Moreover, Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, “Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has played the prostitute there.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.3.7">I said after she had done all these things, ‘She will return to me;’ but she didn’t return; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.3.8">I saw when, for this very cause, that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, had no fear; but she also went and played the prostitute.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.3.9">Because she took her prostitution lightly, the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with wood.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.3.10">Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.3.11">Yahweh said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.3.12">Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, you backsliding Israel,’ says Yahweh; ‘I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will not keep anger forever.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.3.13">Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,’ says Yahweh.”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.3.14">“Return, backsliding children,” says Yahweh; “for I am a husband to you. I will take one of you from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.3.15">I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.3.16">It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,” says Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘the ark of Yahweh’s covenant!’ It will not come to mind. They won’t remember it. They won’t miss it, nor will another be made.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.3.17">At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh’s Throne;’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Yahweh’s name, to Jerusalem. They will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.3.18">In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.3.19">“But I said, ‘How I desire to put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said, ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JER.3.20">“Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JER.3.21">A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JER.3.22">Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding. “Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JER.3.23">Truly in vain is help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains. Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JER.3.24">But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JER.3.25">Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed Yahweh our God’s voice.”</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JER.4.1">“If you will return, Israel,” says Yahweh, “if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you will not be removed;</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.4.2">and you will swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. The nations will bless themselves in him, and they will glory in him.”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.4.3">For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up your fallow ground, and don’t sow among thorns.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.4.4">Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.4.5">Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let’s go into the fortified cities!’</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.4.6">Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Don’t wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.4.7">A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way. He has gone out from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.4.8">For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn’t turned back from us.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.4.9">“It will happen at that day,” says Yahweh, “that the heart of the king will perish, along with the heart of the princes. The priests will be astonished, and the prophets will wonder.”</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.4.10">Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.4.11">At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.4.12">a full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.4.13">Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.4.14">Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you?</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.4.15">For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.4.16">“Tell the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.4.17">As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,’” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.4.18">“Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.”</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.4.19">My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JER.4.20">Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JER.4.21">How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JER.4.22">“For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but they don’t know how to do good.”</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JER.4.23">I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JER.4.24">I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JER.4.25">I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JER.4.26">I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, before his fierce anger.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JER.4.27">For Yahweh says, “The whole land will be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JER.4.28">For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it. I have planned it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.”</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="JER.4.29">Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers. They go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="JER.4.30">You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with makeup, you make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers despise you. They seek your life.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="JER.4.31">For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.”</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JER.5.1">“Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its wide places, if you can find a man, if there is anyone who does justly, who seeks truth, then I will pardon her.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.5.2">Though they say, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ surely they swear falsely.”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.5.3">O Yahweh, don’t your eyes look on truth? You have stricken them, but they were not grieved. You have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused to return.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.5.4">Then I said, “Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they don’t know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God.</v>

			<v id="16" bcv="JER.28.16">Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’”</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JER.29.1">Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.29.2">(after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem),</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.29.3">by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). It said:</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.29.4">Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.29.5">“Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.29.6">Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and don’t be diminished.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.29.7">Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you will have peace.”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.29.8">For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you. Don’t listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.29.9">For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.29.10">For Yahweh says, “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.29.11">For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,” says Yahweh, “thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.29.12">You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.29.13">You shall seek me, and find me, when you search for me with all your heart.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.29.14">I will be found by you,” says Yahweh, “and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh. I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.”</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.29.15">Because you have said, “Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;”</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.29.16">Yahweh says concerning the king who sits on David’s throne, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who haven’t gone with you into captivity;</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.29.17">Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that can’t be eaten, they are so bad.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.29.18">I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.29.19">because they have not listened to my words,” says Yahweh, “with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JER.29.20">Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you captives, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JER.29.21">Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: “Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he will kill them before your eyes.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JER.29.22">A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JER.29.23">because they have done foolish things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them. I am he who knows, and am witness,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JER.29.24">Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JER.29.25">“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JER.29.26">“Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in Yahweh’s house, for every man who is crazy, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JER.29.27">Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JER.29.28">because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?”’”</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="JER.29.29">Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="JER.29.30">Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="JER.29.31">“Send to all of the captives, saying, ‘Yahweh says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie;”</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="JER.29.32">therefore Yahweh says, “Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He won’t see the good that I will do to my people,” says Yahweh, “because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.”’”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="30">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.30.1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.30.2">“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.30.3">For, behold, the days come,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will reverse the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.30.4">These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.30.5">For Yahweh says:“We have heard a voice of trembling;a voice of fear, and not of peace.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.30.6">Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child. Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,and all faces are turned pale?</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.30.7">Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it. It is even the time of Jacob’s trouble;but he will be saved out of it.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.30.8">It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck,and will burst your bonds. Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.30.9">but they will serve Yahweh their God,and David their king,whom I will raise up to them.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.30.10">Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh. Don’t be dismayed, Israel. For, behold, I will save you from afar,and save your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return,and will be quiet and at ease. No one will make him afraid.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.30.11">For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you;for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,but I will not make a full end of you;but I will correct you in measure,and will in no way leave you unpunished.”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.30.12">For Yahweh says,“Your hurt is incurable. Your wound is grievous.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.30.13">There is no one to plead your cause,that you may be bound up. You have no healing medicines.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.30.14">All your lovers have forgotten you. They don’t seek you. For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,with the chastisement of a cruel one,for the greatness of your iniquity,because your sins were increased.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.30.15">Why do you cry over your injury?Your pain is incurable. For the greatness of your iniquity,because your sins have increased,I have done these things to you.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.30.16">Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured. All your adversaries, everyone of them, will go into captivity. Those who plunder you will be plunder. I will make all who prey on you become prey.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.30.17">For I will restore health to you,and I will heal you of your wounds,” says Yahweh;“because they have called you an outcast,saying, ‘It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.’”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.30.18">Yahweh says:“Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob’s tents,and have compassion on his dwelling places. The city will be built on its own hill,and the palace will be inhabited in its own place.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.30.19">Thanksgiving will proceed out of themwith the voice of those who make merry. I will multiply them,and they will not be few;I will also glorify them,and they will not be small.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JER.30.20">Their children also will be as before,and their congregation will be established before me. I will punish all who oppress them.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JER.30.21">Their prince will be one of them,and their ruler will proceed from among them. I will cause him to draw near,and he will approach me;for who is he who has had boldness to approach me?” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JER.30.22">“You shall be my people,and I will be your God.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JER.30.23">Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out,a sweeping storm:it will burst on the head of the wicked.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JER.30.24">The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return until he has accomplished,and until he has performed the intentions of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it.”</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="JER.31.3">Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying,“Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore I have drawn you with loving kindness.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.31.4">I will build you again,and you will be built, O virgin of Israel. You will again be adorned with your tambourines,and will go out in the dances of those who make merry.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.31.5">Again you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. The planters will plant,and will enjoy its fruit.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.31.6">For there will be a day that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim cry,‘Arise! Let’s go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.’”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.31.7">For Yahweh says,“Sing with gladness for Jacob,and shout for the chief of the nations. Publish, praise, and say,‘Yahweh, save your people,the remnant of Israel!’</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.31.8">Behold, I will bring them from the north country,and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth,along with the blind and the lame,the woman with child and her who travails with child together. They will return as a great company.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.31.9">They will come with weeping. I will lead them with petitions. I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters,in a straight way in which they won’t stumble;for I am a father to Israel. Ephraim is my firstborn.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.31.10">“Hear Yahweh’s word, you nations,and declare it in the distant islands. Say,‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.’</v>

			<v id="12" bcv="JER.31.12">They will come and sing in the height of Zion,and will flow to the goodness of Yahweh,to the grain, to the new wine, to the oil,and to the young of the flock and of the herd. Their soul will be as a watered garden. They will not sorrow any more at all.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.31.13">Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance;the young men and the old together;for I will turn their mourning into joy,and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.31.14">I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,” says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.31.15">Yahweh says:“A voice is heard in Ramah,lamentation and bitter weeping,Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for her children,because they are no more.”</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.31.16">Yahweh says:“Refrain your voice from weeping,and your eyes from tears;for your work will be rewarded,” says Yahweh. “They will come again from the land of the enemy.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.31.17">There is hope for your latter end,” says Yahweh. “Your children will come again to their own territory.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.31.18">“I have surely heard Ephraim grieving thus,‘You have chastised me,and I was chastised, as an untrained calf. Turn me, and I will be turned;for you are Yahweh my God.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JER.32.1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.32.2">Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.32.3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.32.4">and Zedekiah king of Judah won’t escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes;</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.32.5">and he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him,” says Yahweh: “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you will not prosper?”’”</v>

Buy it for yourself.’“Then I knew that this was Yahweh’s word.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.32.9">I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.32.10">I signed the deed, sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances to him.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.32.11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.32.12">and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.32.13">“I commanded Baruch before them, saying,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.32.14">Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.’</v>

			<v id="22" bcv="JER.32.22">and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JER.32.23">They came in and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do. Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JER.32.24">“Behold, siege ramps have come to the city to take it. The city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, of the famine, and of the pestilence. What you have spoken has happened. Behold, you see it.</v>

			<v id="30" bcv="JER.32.30">“For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="JER.32.31">For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before my face,</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="JER.32.32">because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="JER.32.33">They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="JER.32.34">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="JER.32.35">They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech; which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.”</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="JER.32.36">Now therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning this city, about which you say, “It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:”</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="JER.32.37">“Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell safely.</v>

			<v id="39" bcv="JER.32.39">I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good, and the good of their children after them.</v>
			<v id="40" bcv="JER.32.40">I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</v>
			<v id="41" bcv="JER.32.41">Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.”</v>
			<v id="42" bcv="JER.32.42">For Yahweh says: “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.</v>

			<v id="2" bcv="JER.34.2">“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.34.3">You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Babylon.”’</v>

			<v id="6" bcv="JER.34.6">Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</v>

			<v id="15" bcv="JER.34.15">You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;</v>

			<v id="5" bcv="JER.35.5">I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”</v>

			<v id="9" bcv="JER.36.9">Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.36.10">Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.36.11">When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.36.12">he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.36.13">Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.36.14">Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.”So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.36.15">They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.”So Baruch read it in their hearing.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.36.16">Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.”</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.36.17">They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.36.18">Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”</v>

			<v id="26" bcv="JER.36.26">The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JER.36.27">Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JER.36.28">“Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="JER.36.29">Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written therein, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal?’”’</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="JER.36.30">Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="JER.36.31">I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”’”</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="JER.36.32">Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JER.38.1">Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.38.2">“Yahweh says, ‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live, and he will escape with his life, and he will live.’</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.38.3">Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.38.4">Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.”</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.38.5">Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.”</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.38.6">Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.38.7">Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate),</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.38.8">Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.38.9">“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.”</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.38.10">Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.38.11">So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.38.12">Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.”Jeremiah did so.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.38.13">So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.38.14">Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house. Then the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.”</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.38.15">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.38.16">So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.38.17">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.38.18">But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’”</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.38.19">Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.”</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JER.38.20">But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul will live.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JER.38.21">But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JER.38.22">‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say,“Your familiar friends have turned on you,and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire,they have turned away from you.”</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JER.38.23">They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’”</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JER.38.24">Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JER.38.25">But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JER.38.26">then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’”</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JER.38.27">Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JER.38.28">So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="39">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.39.1">In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.39.2">In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.39.3">All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.39.4">When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.39.5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.39.6">Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.39.7">Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.39.8">The Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.39.9">Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.39.10">But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.39.11">Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.39.12">“Take him, and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.39.13">So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, with Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.39.14">they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he lived among the people.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.39.15">Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.39.16">“Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.39.17">But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.39.18">For I will surely save you, and you won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life; because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="40">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.40.1">The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.40.2">The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, “Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.40.3">and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.40.4">Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.”</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.40.5">Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.”So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.40.6">Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.40.7">Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.40.8">then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.40.9">Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.40.10">As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.40.11">Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.40.12">then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.40.13">Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.40.14">and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?”But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.40.15">Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.40.16">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="41">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.41.1">Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.41.2">Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.41.3">Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.41.4">The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.41.5">men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.41.6">Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.41.7">It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.41.8">But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.”So he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.41.9">Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.41.10">Then Ishmael carried away captive all the of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.41.11">But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.41.12">then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.41.13">Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.41.14">So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.41.15">But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.41.16">Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.41.17">They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.41.18">because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="42">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.42.1">Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.42.2">and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us;</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.42.3">that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the things that we should do.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.42.4">Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words; and it will happen that whatever thing Yahweh answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.”</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.42.5">Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God sends you to tell us.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.42.6">Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.42.7">After ten days, Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.42.8">Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.42.9">and said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him, says:</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.42.10">‘If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.42.11">Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Don’t be afraid of him,’ says Yahweh: ‘for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.42.12">I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.42.13">“‘But if you say, “We will not dwell in this land;” so that you don’t obey Yahweh your God’s voice,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JER.42.14">saying, “No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:”’</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JER.42.15">now therefore hear Yahweh’s word, O remnant of Judah: Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to live there;</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JER.42.16">then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will follow close behind you there in Egypt; and you will die there.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JER.42.17">So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JER.42.18">For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and my wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you, when you enter into Egypt; and you will be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.’</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JER.42.19">“Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, ‘Don’t go into Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have testified to you today.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JER.42.20">For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God says, so declare to us, and we will do it.’</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JER.42.21">I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed Yahweh your God’s voice in anything for which he has sent me to you.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JER.42.22">Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live there.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="43">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.43.1">When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these words,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.43.2">then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely. Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, ‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.43.3">but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.43.4">So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.43.5">But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah;</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JER.43.6">the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JER.43.7">and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice: and they came to Tahpanhes.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JER.43.8">Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JER.43.9">“Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JER.43.10">and tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JER.43.11">He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JER.43.12">I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JER.43.13">He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.’”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="44">
			<v id="1" bcv="JER.44.1">The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JER.44.2">“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah. Behold, today they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them,</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JER.44.3">because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JER.44.4">However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.”</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JER.44.5">But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other gods.</v>

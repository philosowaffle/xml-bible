			<v id="1" bcv="DEU.1.1">These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="DEU.1.2">It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.1.3">In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them,</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.1.4">after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.1.5">Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.1.6">“Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ‘You have lived long enough at this mountain.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.1.7">Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.1.8">Behold, after them.’”</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.1.9">I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.1.10">Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.1.11">Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you!</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.1.12">How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife?</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.1.13">Take wise men of understanding who are respected among to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.1.14">You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.”</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.1.15">So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.1.16">I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.1.17">You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.1.18">I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.1.19">We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.1.20">I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="DEU.1.21">Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh the God of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.”</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="DEU.1.22">You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.”</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="DEU.1.23">The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="DEU.1.24">They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="DEU.1.25">They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.”</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="DEU.1.26">Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="DEU.1.27">You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="DEU.1.28">Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’”</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="DEU.1.29">Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="DEU.1.30">Yahweh your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="DEU.1.31">and in the wilderness where you have seen how that Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.”</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="DEU.1.32">Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God,</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="DEU.1.33">who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="DEU.1.34">Yahweh heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying,</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="DEU.1.35">“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers,</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="DEU.1.36">except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.”</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="DEU.1.37">Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there.</v>
			<v id="38" bcv="DEU.1.38">Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</v>
			<v id="39" bcv="DEU.1.39">Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.</v>
			<v id="40" bcv="DEU.1.40">But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”</v>
			<v id="41" bcv="DEU.1.41">Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.</v>
			<v id="42" bcv="DEU.1.42">Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’”</v>
			<v id="43" bcv="DEU.1.43">So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.</v>
			<v id="44" bcv="DEU.1.44">The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.</v>
			<v id="45" bcv="DEU.1.45">You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you.</v>
			<v id="46" bcv="DEU.1.46">So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="2">
			<v id="1" bcv="DEU.2.1">Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="DEU.2.2">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.2.3">“You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.2.4">Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.2.5">Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.2.6">You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.2.7">For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.2.8">So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.2.9">Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.”</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.2.10">(The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.2.11">These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.2.12">The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them. )</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.2.13">“Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.2.14">The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.2.15">Moreover Yahweh’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.2.16">So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.2.17">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.2.18">“You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.2.19">When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.”</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.2.20">(That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="DEU.2.21">a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place;</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="DEU.2.22">as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="DEU.2.23">Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place. )</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="DEU.2.24">“Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="DEU.2.25">Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.”</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="DEU.2.26">I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="DEU.2.27">“Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="DEU.2.28">You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet,</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="DEU.2.29">as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.”</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="DEU.2.30">But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="DEU.2.31">Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.”</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="DEU.2.32">Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="DEU.2.33">Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="DEU.2.34">We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="DEU.2.35">Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken.</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="DEU.2.36">From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh our God delivered up all before us.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="DEU.2.37">Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="3">
			<v id="1" bcv="DEU.3.1">Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="DEU.3.2">Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people, and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.3.3">So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.3.4">We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.3.5">All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages without walls.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.3.6">We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.3.7">But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.3.8">We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.3.9">(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir. )</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.3.10">We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.3.11">(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a man. )</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.3.12">This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites;</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.3.13">and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.3.14">Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day. )</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.3.15">I gave Gilead to Machir.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.3.16">To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.3.17">the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.3.18">I commanded you at that time, saying, “Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Israel.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.3.19">But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.3.20">until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own possession, which I have given you.”</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="DEU.3.21">I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="DEU.3.22">You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.”</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="DEU.3.23">I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="DEU.3.24">“Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours?</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="DEU.3.25">Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.”</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="DEU.3.26">But Yahweh was angry with me because of you, and didn’t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, “That is enough! Speak no more to me of this matter.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="DEU.3.27">Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="DEU.3.28">But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.”</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="DEU.3.29">So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="4">
			<v id="1" bcv="DEU.4.1">Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="DEU.4.2">You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.4.3">Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for Yahweh your God has destroyed all the men who followed Baal Peor from among you.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.4.4">But you who were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive today.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.4.5">Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in to possess it.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.4.6">Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.4.7">For what great nation is there that has a god so near to them as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.4.8">What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which I set before you today?</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.4.9">Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children—</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.4.10">the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.4.11">You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.4.12">Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.4.13">He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.4.14">Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.4.15">Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.4.16">lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.4.17">the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.4.18">the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.4.19">and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.4.20">But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="DEU.4.21">Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance;</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="DEU.4.22">but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over and possess that good land.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="DEU.4.23">Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="DEU.4.24">For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="DEU.4.25">When you shall father children and children’s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight to provoke him to anger,</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="DEU.4.26">I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="DEU.4.27">Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where Yahweh will lead you away.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="DEU.4.28">There you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="DEU.4.29">But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="DEU.4.30">When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God and listen to his voice.</v>

			<v id="32" bcv="DEU.4.32">For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as great as this thing is, or has been heard like it?</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="DEU.4.33">Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="DEU.4.34">Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="DEU.4.35">It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides him.</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="DEU.4.36">Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="DEU.4.37">Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;</v>

			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.5.14">but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in which you shall not do any work— neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.5.15">You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. Therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.5.16">“Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.8.3">He humbled you, and allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know; that he might teach you that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of Yahweh’s mouth.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.9.3">Know therefore today, that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out, and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.9.4">Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;” because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.9.5">Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.9.6">Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.9.7">Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.9.8">Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.9.9">When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.9.10">Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with God’s finger. On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.9.11">It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.9.12">Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned away from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image for themselves!”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.9.13">Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.9.14">Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.9.15">So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.9.16">I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which Yahweh had commanded you.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.9.17">I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.9.18">I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.9.19">For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.9.20">Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</v>

			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.31.10">Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths,</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.31.11">when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.31.12">Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.31.13">and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.31.14">Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.”Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.31.15">Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.31.16">Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.31.17">Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our God is not among us?’</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.31.18">I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.31.19">“Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.31.20">For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="DEU.31.21">It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.”</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="DEU.31.22">So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="DEU.31.23">He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.”</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="DEU.31.24">When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="DEU.31.25">Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, saying,</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="DEU.31.26">“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh your God’s covenant, that it may be there for a witness against you.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="DEU.31.27">For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. How much more after my death?</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="DEU.31.28">Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="DEU.31.29">For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn away from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.”</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="DEU.31.30">Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="32">
			<v id="1" bcv="DEU.32.1">Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="DEU.32.2">My doctrine will drop as the rain. My speech will condense as the dew,as the misty rain on the tender grass,as the showers on the herb.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.32.3">For I will proclaim Yahweh’s name. Ascribe greatness to our God!</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.32.4">The Rock, his work is perfect,for all his ways are just. A God of faithfulness who does no wrong,just and right is he.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.32.5">They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his children, because of their defect. They are a perverse and crooked generation.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.32.6">Is this the way you repay Yahweh,foolish and unwise people?Isn’t he your father who has bought you?He has made you and established you.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.32.7">Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you;your elders, and they will tell you.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.32.8">When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,when he separated the children of men,he set the bounds of the peoplesaccording to the number of the children of Israel.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.32.9">For Yahweh’s portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.32.10">He found him in a desert land,in the waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.32.11">As an eagle that stirs up her nest,that flutters over her young,he spread abroad his wings,he took them,he bore them on his feathers.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.32.12">Yahweh alone led him. There was no foreign god with him.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.32.13">He made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock,oil out of the flinty rock;</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.32.14">butter from the herd, and milk from the flock,with fat of lambs,rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,with the finest of the wheat. From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.32.15">But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he abandoned God who made him,and rejected the Rock of his salvation.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.32.16">They moved him to jealousy with strange gods. They provoked him to anger with abominations.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.32.17">They sacrificed to demons, not God,to gods that they didn’t know,to new gods that came up recently,which your fathers didn’t dread.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.32.18">Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,and have forgotten God who gave you birth.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.32.19">Yahweh saw and abhorred,because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.32.20">He said, “I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end will be;for they are a very perverse generation,children in whom is no faithfulness.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="DEU.32.21">They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="DEU.32.22">For a fire is kindled in my anger,that burns to the lowest Sheol,devours the earth with its increase,and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="DEU.32.23">“I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="DEU.32.24">They shall be wasted with hunger,and devoured with burning heatand bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them,with the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="DEU.32.25">Outside the sword will bereave,and in the rooms, terror;on both young man and virgin,the nursing infant with the gray-haired man.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="DEU.32.26">I said that I would scatter them afar. I would make their memory to cease from among men;</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="DEU.32.27">were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,lest their adversaries should judge wrongly,lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted,Yahweh has not done all this.’”</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="DEU.32.28">For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="DEU.32.29">Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,that they would consider their latter end!</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="DEU.32.30">How could one chase a thousand,and two put ten thousand to flight,unless their Rock had sold them,and Yahweh had delivered them up?</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="DEU.32.31">For their rock is not as our Rock,even our enemies themselves concede.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="DEU.32.32">For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poison grapes. Their clusters are bitter.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="DEU.32.33">Their wine is the poison of serpents,the cruel venom of asps.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="DEU.32.34">“Isn’t this laid up in store with me,sealed up among my treasures?</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="DEU.32.35">Vengeance is mine, and recompense,at the time when their foot slides;for the day of their calamity is at hand. Their doom rushes at them.”</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="DEU.32.36">For Yahweh will judge his people,and have compassion on his servants,when he sees that their power is gone;that there is no one remaining, shut up or left at large.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="DEU.32.37">He will say, “Where are their gods,the rock in which they took refuge;</v>
			<v id="38" bcv="DEU.32.38">which ate the fat of their sacrifices,and drank the wine of their drink offering?Let them rise up and help you!Let them be your protection.</v>
			<v id="39" bcv="DEU.32.39">“See now that I myself am he. There is no god with me. I kill and I make alive. I wound and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.</v>
			<v id="40" bcv="DEU.32.40">For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare,as I live forever,</v>
			<v id="41" bcv="DEU.32.41">if I sharpen my glittering sword,my hand grasps it in judgment;I will take vengeance on my adversaries,and will repay those who hate me.</v>
			<v id="42" bcv="DEU.32.42">I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”</v>
			<v id="43" bcv="DEU.32.43">Rejoice, you nations, with his people,for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will take vengeance on his adversaries,and will make atonement for his land and for his people.</v>
			<v id="44" bcv="DEU.32.44">Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.</v>
			<v id="45" bcv="DEU.32.45">Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel.</v>
			<v id="46" bcv="DEU.32.46">He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</v>
			<v id="47" bcv="DEU.32.47">For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”</v>
			<v id="48" bcv="DEU.32.48">Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,</v>
			<v id="49" bcv="DEU.32.49">“Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession.</v>
			<v id="50" bcv="DEU.32.50">Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;</v>
			<v id="51" bcv="DEU.32.51">because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of Israel.</v>
			<v id="52" bcv="DEU.32.52">For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="33">
			<v id="1" bcv="DEU.33.1">This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="DEU.33.2">He said,“Yahweh came from Sinai,and rose from Seir to them. He shone from Mount Paran. He came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At his right hand was a fiery law for them.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.33.3">Yes, he loves the people. All his saints are in your hand. They sat down at your feet. Each receives your words.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.33.4">Moses commanded us a law,an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.33.5">He was king in Jeshurun,when the heads of the people were gathered,all the tribes of Israel together.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.33.6">“Let Reuben live, and not die;Nor let his men be few.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.33.7">This is for Judah. He said,“Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah. Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself. You shall be a help against his adversaries.”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.33.8">About Levi he said,“Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,whom you proved at Massah,with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.33.9">He said of his father, and of his mother, ‘I have not seen him.’He didn’t acknowledge his brothers,nor did he know his own children;for they have observed your word,and keep your covenant.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.33.10">They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,and Israel your law. They shall put incense before you,and whole burnt offering on your altar.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.33.11">Yahweh, bless his skills. Accept the work of his hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,of those who hate him, that they not rise again.”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.33.12">About Benjamin he said,“The beloved of Yahweh will dwell in safety by him. He covers him all day long. He dwells between his shoulders.”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="DEU.33.13">About Joseph he said,“His land is blessed by Yahweh,for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew,for the deep that couches beneath,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="DEU.33.14">for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,for the precious things that the moon can yield,</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="DEU.33.15">for the best things of the ancient mountains,for the precious things of the everlasting hills,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="DEU.33.16">for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,the good will of him who lived in the bush. Let this come on the head of Joseph,on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="DEU.33.17">The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he will push all the peoples, to the ends of the earth. They are the ten thousands of Ephraim. They are the thousands of Manasseh.”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="DEU.33.18">About Zebulun he said,“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;and Issachar, in your tents.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="DEU.33.19">They will call the peoples to the mountain. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness,for they will draw out the abundance of the seas,the hidden treasures of the sand.”</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="DEU.33.20">About Gad he said,“He who enlarges Gad is blessed. He dwells as a lioness,and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="DEU.33.21">He provided the first part for himself,for the lawgiver’s portion reserved was reserved for him. He came with the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of Yahweh,His ordinances with Israel.”</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="DEU.33.22">About Dan he said,“Dan is a lion’s cubthat leaps out of Bashan.”</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="DEU.33.23">About Naphtali he said,“Naphtali, satisfied with favor,full of Yahweh’s blessing,Possess the west and the south.”</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="DEU.33.24">About Asher he said,“Asher is blessed with children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers. Let him dip his foot in oil.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="DEU.33.25">Your bars will be iron and bronze. As your days, so your strength will be.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="DEU.33.26">“There is no one like God, Jeshurun,who rides on the heavens for your help,in his excellency on the skies.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="DEU.33.27">The eternal God is your dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He thrust out the enemy from before you,and said, ‘Destroy!’</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="DEU.33.28">Israel dwells in safety;the fountain of Jacob alone,In a land of grain and new wine. Yes, his heavens drop down dew.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="DEU.33.29">You are happy, Israel!Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,the shield of your help,the sword of your excellency?Your enemies will submit themselves to you. You will tread on their high places.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="34">
			<v id="1" bcv="DEU.34.1">Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="DEU.34.2">and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the Western Sea,</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="DEU.34.3">and the south, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="DEU.34.4">Yahweh said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.”</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="DEU.34.5">So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to Yahweh’s word.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="DEU.34.6">He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where his tomb is to this day.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="DEU.34.7">Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his strength gone.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="DEU.34.8">The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="DEU.34.9">Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him. The children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="DEU.34.10">Since then, there has not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face,</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="DEU.34.11">in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="DEU.34.12">and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds, which Moses did in the sight of all Israel.</v>

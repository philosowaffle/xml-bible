			<v id="1" bcv="PRO.1.1">The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PRO.1.2">to know wisdom and instruction;to discern the words of understanding;</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PRO.1.3">to receive instruction in wise dealing,in righteousness, justice, and equity;</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PRO.1.4">to give prudence to the simple,knowledge and discretion to the young man:</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PRO.1.5">that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PRO.1.6">to understand a proverb, and parables,the words and riddles of the wise.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PRO.1.7">The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge;but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PRO.1.8">My son, listen to your father’s instruction,and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching:</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PRO.1.9">for they will be a garland to grace your head,and chains around your neck.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PRO.1.10">My son, if sinners entice you,don’t consent.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PRO.1.11">If they say, “Come with us. Let’s lay in wait for blood. Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PRO.1.12">Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,and whole, like those who go down into the pit.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PRO.1.13">We’ll find all valuable wealth. We’ll fill our houses with plunder.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PRO.1.14">You shall cast your lot among us. We’ll all have one purse.”</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PRO.1.15">My son, don’t walk on the path with them. Keep your foot from their path,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PRO.1.16">for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PRO.1.17">For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PRO.1.18">but these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PRO.1.19">So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PRO.1.20">Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PRO.1.21">She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PRO.1.22">“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,and fools hate knowledge?</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PRO.1.23">Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="PRO.1.24">Because I have called, and you have refused;I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="PRO.1.25">but you have ignored all my counsel,and wanted none of my reproof;</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="PRO.1.26">I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="PRO.1.27">when calamity overtakes you like a storm,when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;when distress and anguish come on you.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="PRO.1.28">Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="PRO.1.29">because they hated knowledge,and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="PRO.1.30">They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="PRO.1.31">Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,and be filled with their own schemes.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="PRO.1.32">For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="PRO.1.33">But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="2">
			<v id="1" bcv="PRO.2.1">My son, if you will receive my words,and store up my commandments within you;</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PRO.2.2">So as to turn your ear to wisdom,and apply your heart to understanding;</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PRO.2.3">Yes, if you call out for discernment,and lift up your voice for understanding;</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PRO.2.4">If you seek her as silver,and search for her as for hidden treasures:</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PRO.2.5">then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,and find the knowledge of God.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PRO.2.6">For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PRO.2.7">He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PRO.2.8">that he may guard the paths of justice,and preserve the way of his saints.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PRO.2.9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice,equity and every good path.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PRO.2.10">For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PRO.2.11">Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PRO.2.12">to deliver you from the way of evil,from the men who speak perverse things;</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PRO.2.13">who forsake the paths of uprightness,to walk in the ways of darkness;</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PRO.2.14">who rejoice to do evil,and delight in the perverseness of evil;</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PRO.2.15">who are crooked in their ways,and wayward in their paths:</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PRO.2.16">To deliver you from the strange woman,even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PRO.2.17">who forsakes the friend of her youth,and forgets the covenant of her God:</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PRO.2.18">for her house leads down to death,her paths to the departed spirits.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PRO.2.19">None who go to her return again,neither do they attain to the paths of life:</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PRO.2.20">that you may walk in the way of good men,and keep the paths of the righteous.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PRO.2.21">For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PRO.2.22">But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="3">
			<v id="1" bcv="PRO.3.1">My son, don’t forget my teaching;but let your heart keep my commandments:</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PRO.3.2">for length of days, and years of life,and peace, they will add to you.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PRO.3.3">Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PRO.3.4">So you will find favor,and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PRO.3.5">Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,and don’t lean on your own understanding.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PRO.3.6">In all your ways acknowledge him,and he will make your paths straight.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PRO.3.7">Don’t be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PRO.3.8">It will be health to your body,and nourishment to your bones.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PRO.3.9">Honor Yahweh with your substance,with the first fruits of all your increase:</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PRO.3.10">so your barns will be filled with plenty,and your vats will overflow with new wine.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PRO.3.11">My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline,neither be weary of his reproof:</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PRO.3.12">for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves;even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PRO.3.13">Happy is the man who finds wisdom,the man who gets understanding.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PRO.3.14">For her good profit is better than getting silver,and her return is better than fine gold.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PRO.3.15">She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PRO.3.16">Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PRO.3.17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PRO.3.18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PRO.3.19">By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PRO.3.20">By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,and the skies drop down the dew.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PRO.3.21">My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PRO.3.22">so they will be life to your soul,and grace for your neck.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PRO.3.23">Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won’t stumble.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="PRO.3.24">When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="PRO.3.25">Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="PRO.3.26">for Yahweh will be your confidence,and will keep your foot from being taken.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="PRO.3.27">Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="PRO.3.28">Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again;tomorrow I will give it to you,”when you have it by you.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="PRO.3.29">Don’t devise evil against your neighbor,since he dwells securely by you.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="PRO.3.30">Don’t strive with a man without cause,if he has done you no harm.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="PRO.3.31">Don’t envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="PRO.3.32">For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,but his friendship is with the upright.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="PRO.3.33">Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked,but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="PRO.3.34">Surely he mocks the mockers,but he gives grace to the humble.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="PRO.3.35">The wise will inherit glory,but shame will be the promotion of fools.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="4">
			<v id="1" bcv="PRO.4.1">Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. Pay attention and know understanding;</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PRO.4.2">for I give you sound learning. Don’t forsake my law.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PRO.4.3">For I was a son to my father,tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PRO.4.4">He taught me, and said to me:“Let your heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PRO.4.5">Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PRO.4.6">Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PRO.4.7">Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PRO.4.8">Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PRO.4.9">She will give to your head a garland of grace. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PRO.4.10">Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PRO.4.11">I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PRO.4.12">When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PRO.4.13">Take firm hold of instruction. Don’t let her go. Keep her, for she is your life.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PRO.4.14">Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. Don’t walk in the way of evil men.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PRO.4.15">Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PRO.4.16">For they don’t sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PRO.4.17">For they eat the bread of wickedness,and drink the wine of violence.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PRO.4.18">But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,that shines more and more until the perfect day.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PRO.4.19">The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don’t know what they stumble over.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PRO.4.20">My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PRO.4.21">Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the center of your heart.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PRO.4.22">For they are life to those who find them,and health to their whole body.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PRO.4.23">Keep your heart with all diligence,for out of it is the wellspring of life.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="PRO.4.24">Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="PRO.4.25">Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="PRO.4.26">Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="PRO.4.27">Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="5">
			<v id="1" bcv="PRO.5.1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding:</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PRO.5.2">that you may maintain discretion,that your lips may preserve knowledge.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PRO.5.3">For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil,</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PRO.5.4">but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PRO.5.5">Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PRO.5.6">She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PRO.5.7">Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PRO.5.8">Remove your way far from her. Don’t come near the door of her house,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PRO.5.9">lest you give your honor to others,and your years to the cruel one;</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PRO.5.10">lest strangers feast on your wealth,and your labors enrich another man’s house.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PRO.5.11">You will groan at your latter end,when your flesh and your body are consumed,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PRO.5.12">and say, “How I have hated instruction,and my heart despised reproof;</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PRO.5.13">neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PRO.5.14">I have come to the brink of utter ruin,among the gathered assembly.”</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PRO.5.15">Drink water out of your own cistern,running water out of your own well.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PRO.5.16">Should your springs overflow in the streets,streams of water in the public squares?</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PRO.5.17">Let them be for yourself alone,not for strangers with you.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PRO.5.18">Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PRO.5.19">A loving doe and a graceful deer—let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PRO.5.20">For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?Why embrace the bosom of another?</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PRO.5.21">For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes. He examines all his paths.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PRO.5.22">The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PRO.5.23">He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="6">
			<v id="1" bcv="PRO.6.1">My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PRO.6.2">You are trapped by the words of your mouth. You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PRO.6.3">Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PRO.6.4">Give no sleep to your eyes,nor slumber to your eyelids.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PRO.6.5">Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PRO.6.6">Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise;</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PRO.6.7">which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PRO.6.8">provides her bread in the summer,and gathers her food in the harvest.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PRO.6.9">How long will you sleep, sluggard?When will you arise out of your sleep?</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PRO.6.10">A little sleep, a little slumber,a little folding of the hands to sleep:</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PRO.6.11">so your poverty will come as a robber,and your scarcity as an armed man.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PRO.6.12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity,is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PRO.6.13">who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,who motions with his fingers;</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PRO.6.14">in whose heart is perverseness,who devises evil continually,who always sows discord.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PRO.6.15">Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PRO.6.16">There are six things which Yahweh hates;yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PRO.6.17">arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,hands that shed innocent blood;</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PRO.6.18">a heart that devises wicked schemes,feet that are swift in running to mischief,</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PRO.6.19">a false witness who utters lies,and he who sows discord among brothers.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PRO.6.20">My son, keep your father’s commandment,and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PRO.6.21">Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PRO.6.22">When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PRO.6.23">For the commandment is a lamp,and the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="PRO.6.24">to keep you from the immoral woman,from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="PRO.6.25">Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="PRO.6.26">For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="PRO.6.27">Can a man scoop fire into his lap,and his clothes not be burned?</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="PRO.6.28">Or can one walk on hot coals,and his feet not be scorched?</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="PRO.6.29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="PRO.6.30">Men don’t despise a thief,if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="PRO.6.31">but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="PRO.6.32">He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="PRO.6.33">He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="PRO.6.34">For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="PRO.6.35">He won’t regard any ransom,neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="7">
			<v id="1" bcv="PRO.7.1">My son, keep my words. Lay up my commandments within you.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PRO.7.2">Keep my commandments and live!Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PRO.7.3">Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PRO.7.4">Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”Call understanding your relative,</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PRO.7.5">that they may keep you from the strange woman,from the foreigner who flatters with her words.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PRO.7.6">For at the window of my house,I looked out through my lattice.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PRO.7.7">I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PRO.7.8">passing through the street near her corner,he went the way to her house,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PRO.7.9">in the twilight, in the evening of the day,in the middle of the night and in the darkness.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PRO.7.10">Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,and with crafty intent.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PRO.7.11">She is loud and defiant. Her feet don’t stay in her house.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PRO.7.12">Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,and lurking at every corner.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PRO.7.13">So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him:</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PRO.7.14">“Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. Today I have paid my vows.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PRO.7.15">Therefore I came out to meet you,to diligently seek your face,and I have found you.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PRO.7.16">I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PRO.7.17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PRO.7.18">Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning. Let’s solace ourselves with loving.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PRO.7.19">For my husband isn’t at home. He has gone on a long journey.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PRO.7.20">He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.”</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PRO.7.21">With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PRO.7.22">He followed her immediately,as an ox goes to the slaughter,as a fool stepping into a noose.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PRO.7.23">Until an arrow strikes through his liver,as a bird hurries to the snare,and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="PRO.7.24">Now therefore, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="PRO.7.25">Don’t let your heart turn to her ways. Don’t go astray in her paths,</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="PRO.7.26">for she has thrown down many wounded. Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.</v>

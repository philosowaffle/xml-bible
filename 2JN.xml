				<v id="1" bcv="2JN.1.1">The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,</v>
				<v id="2" bcv="2JN.1.2">for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:</v>
				<v id="3" bcv="2JN.1.3">Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</v>
				<v id="4" bcv="2JN.1.4">I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</v>
				<v id="5" bcv="2JN.1.5">Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</v>
				<v id="6" bcv="2JN.1.6">This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</v>
				<v id="7" bcv="2JN.1.7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</v>
				<v id="8" bcv="2JN.1.8">Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.</v>
				<v id="9" bcv="2JN.1.9">Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</v>
				<v id="10" bcv="2JN.1.10">If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,</v>
				<v id="11" bcv="2JN.1.11">for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.</v>
				<v id="12" bcv="2JN.1.12">Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</v>
				<v id="13" bcv="2JN.1.13">The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</v>

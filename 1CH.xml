			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.10.1">Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.10.2">The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.10.3">The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.10.4">Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.”But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.10.5">When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.10.6">So Saul died with his three sons; and all his house died together.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.10.7">When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.10.8">On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.10.9">They stripped him, and took his head and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.10.10">They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.10.11">When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.10.12">all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.10.13">So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of Yahweh’s word, which he didn’t keep; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.10.14">and didn’t inquire of Yahweh. Therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.11.1">Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.11.2">In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.11.3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to Yahweh’s word by Samuel.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.11.4">David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.11.5">The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is David’s city.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.11.6">David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.11.7">David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.11.8">He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.11.9">David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.11.10">Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yahweh’s word concerning Israel.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.11.11">This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.11.12">After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.11.13">He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.11.14">They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.11.15">Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.11.16">David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.11.17">David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.11.18">The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.11.19">and said, “My God forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.11.20">Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="1CH.11.21">Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the three.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="1CH.11.22">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="1CH.11.23">He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="1CH.11.24">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="1CH.11.25">Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his guard.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.12.1">Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish. They were among the mighty men, his helpers in war.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.12.2">They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of Benjamin.</v>

			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.12.8">Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains:</v>

			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.12.16">Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.12.17">David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see this and rebuke it.”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.12.18">Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.12.19">Some of Manasseh also joined David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but they didn’t help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.”</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.12.20">As he went to Ziklag, some from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.</v>

			<v id="25" bcv="1CH.12.25">Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand one hundred.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="1CH.12.26">Of the children of Levi four thousand six hundred.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="1CH.12.27">Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand seven hundred,</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="1CH.12.28">and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="1CH.12.29">Of the children of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives, three thousand: for until then, the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Saul’s house.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="1CH.12.30">Of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers’ houses.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="1CH.12.31">Of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="1CH.12.32">Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="1CH.12.33">Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all kinds of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could command and were not of double heart.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="1CH.12.34">Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.</v>

			<v id="36" bcv="1CH.12.36">Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="1CH.12.37">On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand.</v>
			<v id="38" bcv="1CH.12.38">All these were men of war, who could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.</v>
			<v id="39" bcv="1CH.12.39">They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them.</v>
			<v id="40" bcv="1CH.12.40">Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="13">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.13.1">David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.13.2">David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let’s send word everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have pasture lands, that they may gather themselves to us.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.13.3">Also, let’s bring the ark of our God back to us again; for we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.13.4">All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.13.5">So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring God’s ark from Kiriath Jearim.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.13.6">David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there God Yahweh’s ark that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.13.7">They carried God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.13.8">David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.13.9">When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.13.10">Yahweh’s anger burned against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.13.11">David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.13.12">David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring God’s ark home to me?”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.13.13">So David didn’t move the ark with him into David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.13.14">God’s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months; and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom’s house and all that he had.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="14">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.14.1">Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.14.2">David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel’s sake.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.14.3">David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.14.4">These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.14.5">Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.14.6">Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.14.7">Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.14.8">When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.14.9">Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.14.10">David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?”Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.14.11">So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.14.12">They left their gods there; and David gave a command, and they were burned with fire.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.14.13">The Philistines made a another raid in the valley.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.14.14">David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.14.15">When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.14.16">David did as God commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.14.17">The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="15">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.15.1">David made himself houses in David’s city; and he prepared a place for God’s ark, and pitched a tent for it.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.15.2">Then David said, “No one ought to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry God’s ark, and to minister to him forever.”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.15.3">David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yahweh’s ark to its place, which he had prepared for it.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.15.4">David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.15.5">of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.15.6">of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.15.7">of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.15.8">of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.15.9">of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.15.10">of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.15.11">David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.15.12">and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.15.13">For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek him according to the ordinance.”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.15.14">So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.15.15">The children of the Levites bore God’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yahweh’s word.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.15.16">David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.15.17">So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.15.18">and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.15.19">So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud;</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.15.20">and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="1CH.15.21">and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="1CH.15.22">Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skillful.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="1CH.15.23">Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="1CH.15.24">Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before God’s ark; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="1CH.15.25">So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="1CH.15.26">When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="1CH.15.27">David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="1CH.15.28">Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="1CH.15.29">As the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="16">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.16.1">They brought in God’s ark, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.16.2">When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in Yahweh’s name.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.16.3">He gave to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.16.4">He appointed some of the Levites to minister before Yahweh’s ark, and to commemorate, to thank, and to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.16.5">Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.16.6">with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.16.7">Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.16.8">Oh give thanks to Yahweh. Call on his name. Make what he has done known among the peoples.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.16.9">Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Tell of all his marvelous works.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.16.10">Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.16.11">Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.16.12">Remember his marvelous works that he has done,his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.16.13">you offspring of Israel his servant,you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.16.14">He is Yahweh our God. His judgments are in all the earth.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.16.15">Remember his covenant forever,the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.16.16">the covenant which he made with Abraham,his oath to Isaac.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.16.17">He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.16.18">saying, “I will give you the land of Canaan,The lot of your inheritance,”</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.16.19">when you were but a few men in number,yes, very few, and foreigners were in it.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.16.20">They went about from nation to nation,from one kingdom to another people.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="1CH.16.21">He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="1CH.16.22">“Don’t touch my anointed ones!Do my prophets no harm!”</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="1CH.16.23">Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!Display his salvation from day to day.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="1CH.16.24">Declare his glory among the nations,and his marvelous works among all the peoples.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="1CH.16.25">For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="1CH.16.26">For all the gods of the peoples are idols,but Yahweh made the heavens.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="1CH.16.27">Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and gladness are in his place.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="1CH.16.28">Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the peoples,ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength!</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="1CH.16.29">Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come before him. Worship Yahweh in holy array.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="1CH.16.30">Tremble before him, all the earth. The world also is established that it can’t be moved.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="1CH.16.31">Let the heavens be glad,and let the earth rejoice!Let them say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns!”</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="1CH.16.32">Let the sea roar, and its fullness!Let the field exult, and all that is in it!</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="1CH.16.33">Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh,for he comes to judge the earth.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="1CH.16.34">Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,for his loving kindness endures forever.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="1CH.16.35">Say, “Save us, God of our salvation!Gather us together and deliver us from the nations,to give thanks to your holy name,to triumph in your praise.”</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="1CH.16.36">Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,from everlasting even to everlasting. All the people said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="1CH.16.37">So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;</v>
			<v id="38" bcv="1CH.16.38">and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;</v>

			<v id="43" bcv="1CH.16.43">All the people departed, each man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="17">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.17.1">When David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of Yahweh’s covenant is in a tent.”</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.17.2">Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.17.3">That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.17.4">“Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in;</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.17.5">for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.17.6">In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.17.7">“Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.17.8">I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.17.9">I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first,</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.17.10">and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.17.11">It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.17.12">He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.17.13">I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.17.14">but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever.”’”</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.17.15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.17.16">Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.17.17">This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.17.18">What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.17.19">Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.17.20">Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="1CH.17.21">What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="1CH.17.22">For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="1CH.17.23">Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="1CH.17.24">Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="1CH.17.25">For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="1CH.17.26">Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="1CH.17.27">Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.18.1">After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.18.2">He defeated Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.18.3">David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.18.4">David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots.</v>

			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.18.6">Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.</v>

			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.18.8">From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.18.9">When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.18.10">he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.18.11">King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.18.12">Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.18.13">He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.18.14">David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.18.15">Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.18.16">Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; Shavsha was scribe;</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.18.17">and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials serving the king.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="19">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.19.1">After this, Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.19.2">David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.19.3">But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.19.4">So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.19.5">Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.19.6">When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.19.7">So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.19.8">When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.19.9">The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.19.10">Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.19.11">The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.19.12">He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.19.13">Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him.”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.19.14">So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.19.15">When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.19.16">When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and called out the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.19.17">David was told that; so he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.19.18">The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and also killed Shophach the captain of the army.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.19.19">When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him. The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="20">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.20.1">At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.20.2">David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.20.3">He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.20.4">After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.20.5">Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.20.6">There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.20.7">When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother killed him.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.20.8">These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="21">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.21.1">Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.21.2">David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.21.3">Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.21.4">Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.21.5">Joab gave up the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.21.6">But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.21.7">God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.21.8">David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.21.9">Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.21.10">“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.21.11">So Gad came to David, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.21.12">either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’”</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.21.13">David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand; for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.”</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.21.14">So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.21.15">God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.21.16">David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.21.17">David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.21.18">Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.21.19">David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.21.20">Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="1CH.21.21">As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="1CH.21.22">Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="1CH.21.23">Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="1CH.21.24">King David said to Ornan, “No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="1CH.21.25">So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="1CH.21.26">David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="1CH.21.27">Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="1CH.21.28">At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="1CH.21.29">For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="1CH.21.30">But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh’s angel.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="22">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.22.1">Then David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.22.2">David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.22.3">David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and bronze in abundance without weight;</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.22.4">and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.22.5">David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.22.6">Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.22.7">David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.22.8">But Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.22.9">Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.22.10">He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.22.11">Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.22.12">May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.22.13">Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.22.14">Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand talents of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.22.15">There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work;</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.22.16">of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.”</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.22.17">David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.22.18">“Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.22.19">Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for Yahweh’s name.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="23">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.23.1">Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.23.2">He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.23.3">The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.23.4">David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh’s house, six thousand were officers and judges,</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.23.5">four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made for giving praise.”</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.23.6">David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.23.7">Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.23.8">The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.23.9">The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.23.10">The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.23.11">Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.23.12">The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.23.13">The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.23.14">But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.23.15">The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.23.16">The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.23.17">The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.23.18">The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.23.19">The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.23.20">The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="1CH.23.21">The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="1CH.23.22">Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="1CH.23.23">The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="1CH.23.24">These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yahweh’s house, from twenty years old and upward.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="1CH.23.25">For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="1CH.23.26">Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.”</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="1CH.23.27">For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="1CH.23.28">For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh’s house, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God’s house;</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="1CH.23.29">for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size;</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="1CH.23.30">and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="1CH.23.31">and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="1CH.23.32">and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of Yahweh’s house.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="24">
			<v id="1" bcv="1CH.24.1">These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="1CH.24.2">But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.24.3">David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="1CH.24.4">There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="1CH.24.5">Thus they were divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="1CH.24.6">Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="1CH.24.7">Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="1CH.24.8">the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="1CH.24.9">the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="1CH.24.10">the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="1CH.24.11">the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="1CH.24.12">the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="1CH.24.13">the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="1CH.24.14">the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="1CH.24.15">the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="1CH.24.16">the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="1CH.24.17">the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="1CH.24.18">the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="1CH.24.19">This was their ordering in their service, to come into Yahweh’s house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="1CH.24.20">Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="1CH.24.21">Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="1CH.24.22">Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="1CH.24.23">The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="1CH.24.24">The sons of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="1CH.29.3">In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</v>

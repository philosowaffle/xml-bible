			<v id="1" bcv="PSA.1.1">Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,nor stand on the path of sinners,nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PSA.1.2">but his delight is in Yahweh’s law. On his law he meditates day and night.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.1.3">He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,that produces its fruit in its season,whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.1.4">The wicked are not so,but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.1.5">Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.1.6">For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,but the way of the wicked shall perish.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="PSA.2.1">Why do the nations rage,and the peoples plot a vain thing?</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PSA.2.2">The kings of the earth take a stand,and the rulers take counsel together,against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying,</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.2.3">“Let’s break their bonds apart,and cast their cords from us.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.2.4">He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.2.5">Then he will speak to them in his anger,and terrify them in his wrath:</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.2.6">“Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PSA.2.7">I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, “You are my son. Today I have become your father.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PSA.2.8">Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PSA.2.9">You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PSA.2.10">Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PSA.2.11">Serve Yahweh with fear,and rejoice with trembling.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PSA.2.12">Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="PSA.3.1">Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased!Many are those who rise up against me.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PSA.3.2">Many there are who say of my soul,“There is no help for him in God.”
			</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.3.3">But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.3.4">I cry to Yahweh with my voice,and he answers me out of his holy hill. 
			</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.3.5">I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.3.6">I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of peoplewho have set themselves against me on every side.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PSA.3.7">Arise, Yahweh!Save me, my God!For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="PSA.4.1">Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PSA.4.2">You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
			</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.4.3">But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly:Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.4.4">Stand in awe, and don’t sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still.

			<v id="2" bcv="PSA.5.2">Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God;for I pray to you.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.5.3">Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.5.4">For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil can’t live with you.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.5.5">The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of iniquity.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.5.6">You will destroy those who speak lies. Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PSA.5.7">But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PSA.5.8">Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PSA.5.9">For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PSA.5.10">Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels;Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,for they have rebelled against you.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PSA.5.11">But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice,Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PSA.5.12">For you will bless the righteous. Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.6.3">My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh—how long?</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.6.4">Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul,and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.6.5">For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.6.6">I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PSA.6.7">My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PSA.6.8">Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PSA.6.9">Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.7.3">Yahweh, my God, if I have done this,if there is iniquity in my hands,</v>

			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.7.6">Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PSA.7.7">Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PSA.7.8">Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness,and to my integrity that is in me.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PSA.7.9">Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,but establish the righteous;their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PSA.7.10">My shield is with God,who saves the upright in heart.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PSA.7.11">God is a righteous judge,yes, a God who has indignation every day.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PSA.7.12">If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;he has bent and strung his bow.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PSA.7.13">He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PSA.7.14">Behold, he travails with iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief,and brought out falsehood.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PSA.7.15">He has dug a hole,and has fallen into the pit which he made.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PSA.7.16">The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PSA.7.17">I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness,and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.9.3">When my enemies turn back,they stumble and perish in your presence.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.9.4">For you have maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="PSA.10.1">Why do you stand far off, Yahweh?Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="PSA.10.2">In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="PSA.10.3">For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.10.4">The wicked, in the pride of his face,has no room in his thoughts for God.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.10.5">His ways are prosperous at all times. He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight. As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.10.6">He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PSA.10.7">His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PSA.10.8">He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PSA.10.9">He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PSA.10.10">The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under his strength.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PSA.10.11">He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PSA.10.12">Arise, Yahweh!God, lift up your hand!Don’t forget the helpless.</v>

			<v id="14" bcv="PSA.10.14">But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PSA.10.15">Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PSA.10.16">Yahweh is King forever and ever!The nations will perish out of his land.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PSA.10.17">Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,</v>

			<v id="4" bcv="PSA.11.4">Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.11.5">Yahweh examines the righteous,but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.11.6">On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</v>

			<v id="11" bcv="PSA.73.11">They say, “How does God know?Is there knowledge in the Most High?”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PSA.73.12">Behold, these are the wicked. Being always at ease, they increase in riches.</v>

			<v id="20" bcv="PSA.73.20">As a dream when one wakes up,so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PSA.73.21">For my soul was grieved. I was embittered in my heart.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PSA.73.22">I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute beast before you.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PSA.73.23">Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="PSA.73.24">You will guide me with your counsel,and afterward receive me to glory.</v>

			<v id="26" bcv="PSA.73.26">My flesh and my heart fails,but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="PSA.73.27">For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="PSA.73.28">But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge,that I may tell of all your works.</v>

			<v id="18" bcv="PSA.77.18">The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PSA.77.19">Your way was through the sea;your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.</v>

			<v id="5" bcv="PSA.78.5">For he established a covenant in Jacob,and appointed a teaching in Israel,which he commanded our fathers,that they should make them known to their children;</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="PSA.78.6">that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;who should arise and tell their children,</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="PSA.78.7">that they might set their hope in God,and not forget God’s deeds,but keep his commandments,</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="PSA.78.8">and might not be as their fathers,a stubborn and rebellious generation,a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="PSA.78.9">The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,turned back in the day of battle.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="PSA.78.10">They didn’t keep God’s covenant,and refused to walk in his law.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="PSA.78.11">They forgot his doings,his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="PSA.78.12">He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="PSA.78.13">He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="PSA.78.14">In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,and all night with a light of fire.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="PSA.78.15">He split rocks in the wilderness,and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="PSA.78.16">He brought streams also out of the rock,and caused waters to run down like rivers.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="PSA.78.17">Yet they still went on to sin against him,to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="PSA.78.18">They tempted God in their heartby asking food according to their desire.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="PSA.78.19">Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="PSA.78.20">Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also?Will he provide meat for his people?”</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="PSA.78.21">Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob,anger also went up against Israel,</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="PSA.78.22">because they didn’t believe in God,and didn’t trust in his salvation.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="PSA.78.23">Yet he commanded the skies above,and opened the doors of heaven.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="PSA.78.24">He rained down manna on them to eat,and gave them food from the sky.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="PSA.78.25">Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="PSA.78.26">He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="PSA.78.27">He rained also meat on them as the dust;winged birds as the sand of the seas.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="PSA.78.28">He let them fall in the middle of their camp,around their habitations.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="PSA.78.29">So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="PSA.78.30">They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="PSA.78.31">when the anger of God went up against them,killed some of their fattest,and struck down the young men of Israel.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="PSA.78.32">For all this they still sinned,and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.</v>
			<v id="33" bcv="PSA.78.33">Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,and their years in terror.</v>
			<v id="34" bcv="PSA.78.34">When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.</v>
			<v id="35" bcv="PSA.78.35">They remembered that God was their rock,the Most High God, their redeemer.</v>
			<v id="36" bcv="PSA.78.36">But they flattered him with their mouth,and lied to him with their tongue.</v>
			<v id="37" bcv="PSA.78.37">For their heart was not right with him,neither were they faithful in his covenant.</v>
			<v id="38" bcv="PSA.78.38">But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away,and didn’t stir up all his wrath.</v>
			<v id="39" bcv="PSA.78.39">He remembered that they were but flesh,a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.</v>
			<v id="40" bcv="PSA.78.40">How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,and grieved him in the desert!</v>
			<v id="41" bcv="PSA.78.41">They turned again and tempted God,and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</v>
			<v id="42" bcv="PSA.78.42">They didn’t remember his hand,nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</v>
			<v id="43" bcv="PSA.78.43">how he set his signs in Egypt,his wonders in the field of Zoan,</v>
			<v id="44" bcv="PSA.78.44">he turned their rivers into blood,and their streams, so that they could not drink.</v>
			<v id="45" bcv="PSA.78.45">He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;and frogs, which destroyed them.</v>
			<v id="46" bcv="PSA.78.46">He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,and their labor to the locust.</v>
			<v id="47" bcv="PSA.78.47">He destroyed their vines with hail,their sycamore fig trees with frost.</v>
			<v id="48" bcv="PSA.78.48">He gave over their livestock also to the hail,and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</v>
			<v id="49" bcv="PSA.78.49">He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,wrath, indignation, and trouble,and a band of angels of evil.</v>
			<v id="50" bcv="PSA.78.50">He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death,but gave their life over to the pestilence,</v>
			<v id="51" bcv="PSA.78.51">and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</v>
			<v id="52" bcv="PSA.78.52">But he led out his own people like sheep,and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</v>
			<v id="53" bcv="PSA.78.53">He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</v>
			<v id="54" bcv="PSA.78.54">He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</v>
			<v id="55" bcv="PSA.78.55">He also drove out the nations before them,allotted them for an inheritance by line,and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</v>
			<v id="56" bcv="PSA.78.56">Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,and didn’t keep his testimonies;</v>
			<v id="57" bcv="PSA.78.57">but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow.</v>
			<v id="58" bcv="PSA.78.58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places,and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</v>
			<v id="59" bcv="PSA.78.59">When God heard this, he was angry,and greatly abhorred Israel;</v>
			<v id="60" bcv="PSA.78.60">So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,the tent which he placed among men;</v>
			<v id="61" bcv="PSA.78.61">and delivered his strength into captivity,his glory into the adversary’s hand.</v>
			<v id="62" bcv="PSA.78.62">He also gave his people over to the sword,and was angry with his inheritance.</v>
			<v id="63" bcv="PSA.78.63">Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.</v>
			<v id="64" bcv="PSA.78.64">Their priests fell by the sword,and their widows couldn’t weep.</v>
			<v id="65" bcv="PSA.78.65">Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</v>
			<v id="66" bcv="PSA.78.66">He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</v>
			<v id="67" bcv="PSA.78.67">Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</v>
			<v id="68" bcv="PSA.78.68">But chose the tribe of Judah,Mount Zion which he loved.</v>
			<v id="69" bcv="PSA.78.69">He built his sanctuary like the heights,like the earth which he has established forever.</v>
			<v id="70" bcv="PSA.78.70">He also chose David his servant,and took him from the sheepfolds;</v>
			<v id="71" bcv="PSA.78.71">from following the ewes that have their young,he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,and Israel, his inheritance.</v>
			<v id="72" bcv="PSA.78.72">So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</v>

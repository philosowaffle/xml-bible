			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.1.1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.1.2">There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.1.3">His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.1.4">His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.1.5">It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.1.6">Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan also came among them.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.1.7">Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.1.8">Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.1.9">Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.1.10">Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.1.11">But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.1.12">Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.1.13">It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.1.14">that there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.1.15">and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.1.16">While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.1.17">While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.1.18">While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.1.19">and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.1.20">Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.1.21">He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.”</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JOB.1.22">In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="2">
			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.2.1">Again, on the day when the God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.2.2">Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.2.3">Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.2.4">Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.2.5">But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.2.6">Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.2.7">So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.2.8">He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.2.9">Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.2.10">But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.2.11">Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.2.12">When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.2.13">So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</v>
		</c>
		<c id="3">
			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.3.1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.3.2">Job answered:</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.3.3">“Let the day perish in which I was born,the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.3.4">Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it,neither let the light shine on it.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.3.5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes black the day terrify it.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.3.6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.3.7">Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.3.8">Let them curse it who curse the day,who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.3.9">Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none,neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.3.10">because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.3.11">“Why didn’t I die from the womb?Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.3.12">Why did the knees receive me?Or why the breast, that I should nurse?</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.3.13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.3.14">with kings and counselors of the earth,who built up waste places for themselves;</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.3.15">or with princes who had gold,who filled their houses with silver:</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.3.16">or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,as infants who never saw light.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.3.17">There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.3.18">There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.3.19">The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.3.20">“Why is light given to him who is in misery,life to the bitter in soul,</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.3.21">Who long for death, but it doesn’t come;and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JOB.3.22">who rejoice exceedingly,and are glad, when they can find the grave?</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JOB.3.23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,whom God has hedged in?</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JOB.3.24">For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JOB.3.25">For the thing which I fear comes on me,That which I am afraid of comes to me.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JOB.3.26">I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;but trouble comes.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="4">
			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.4.1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.4.2">“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?But who can withhold himself from speaking?</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.4.3">Behold, you have instructed many,you have strengthened the weak hands.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.4.4">Your words have supported him who was falling,You have made firm the feeble knees.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.4.5">But now it has come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.4.6">Isn’t your piety your confidence?Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.4.7">“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?Or where were the upright cut off?</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.4.8">According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,and sow trouble,reap the same.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.4.9">By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.4.10">The roaring of the lion,and the voice of the fierce lion,the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.4.11">The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.4.12">“Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.4.13">In thoughts from the visions of the night,when deep sleep falls on men,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.4.14">fear came on me, and trembling,which made all my bones shake.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.4.15">Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.4.16">It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.4.17">‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.4.18">Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.4.19">How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,whose foundation is in the dust,who are crushed before the moth!</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.4.20">Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.4.21">Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?They die, and that without wisdom.’</v>
		</c>
		<c id="5">
			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.5.1">“Call now; is there any who will answer you?To which of the holy ones will you turn?</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.5.2">For resentment kills the foolish man,and jealousy kills the simple.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.5.3">I have seen the foolish taking root,but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.5.4">His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.5.5">whose harvest the hungry eats up,and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.5.6">For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.5.7">but man is born to trouble,as the sparks fly upward.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.5.8">“But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.5.9">who does great things that can’t be fathomed,marvelous things without number;</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.5.10">who gives rain on the earth,and sends waters on the fields;</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.5.11">so that he sets up on high those who are low,those who mourn are exalted to safety.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.5.12">He frustrates the plans of the crafty,So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.5.13">He takes the wise in their own craftiness;the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.5.14">They meet with darkness in the day time,and grope at noonday as in the night.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.5.15">But he saves from the sword of their mouth,even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.5.16">So the poor has hope,and injustice shuts her mouth.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.5.17">“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.5.18">For he wounds, and binds up. He injures, and his hands make whole.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.5.19">He will deliver you in six troubles;yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.5.20">In famine he will redeem you from death;in war, from the power of the sword.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.5.21">You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JOB.5.22">At destruction and famine you shall laugh,neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JOB.5.23">For you shall be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JOB.5.24">You shall know that your tent is in peace. You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JOB.5.25">You shall know also that your offspring shall be great,Your offspring as the grass of the earth.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JOB.5.26">You shall come to your grave in a full age,like a shock of grain comes in its season.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JOB.5.27">Look this, we have searched it, so it is. Hear it, and know it for your good.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="6">
			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.6.1">Then Job answered,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.6.2">“Oh that my anguish were weighed,and all my calamity laid in the balances!</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.6.3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,therefore have my words been rash.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.6.4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.6.5">Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?Or does the ox low over his fodder?</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.6.6">Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.6.7">My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.6.8">“Oh that I might have my request,that God would grant the thing that I long for,</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.6.9">even that it would please God to crush me;that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.6.10">Be it still my consolation,yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.6.11">What is my strength, that I should wait?What is my end, that I should be patient?</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.6.12">Is my strength the strength of stones?Or is my flesh of bronze?</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.6.13">Isn’t it that I have no help in me,That wisdom is driven quite from me?</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.6.14">“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.6.15">My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,as the channel of brooks that pass away;</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.6.16">Which are black by reason of the ice,in which the snow hides itself.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.6.17">In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.6.18">The caravans that travel beside them turn away. They go up into the waste, and perish.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.6.19">The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.6.20">They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.6.21">For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JOB.6.22">Did I say, ‘Give to me?’or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JOB.6.23">or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JOB.6.24">“Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JOB.6.25">How forcible are words of uprightness!But your reproof, what does it reprove?</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JOB.6.26">Do you intend to reprove words,since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JOB.6.27">Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,and make merchandise of your friend.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JOB.6.28">Now therefore be pleased to look at me,for surely I shall not lie to your face.</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="JOB.6.29">Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous.</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="JOB.6.30">Is there injustice on my tongue?Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?</v>
		</c>
		<c id="7">
			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.7.1">“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth?Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.7.2">As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,as a hireling who looks for his wages,</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.7.3">so am I made to possess months of misery,wearisome nights are appointed to me.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.7.4">When I lie down, I say,‘When shall I arise, and the night be gone?’I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.7.5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.7.6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,and are spent without hope.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.7.7">Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.7.8">The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more. Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.7.9">As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.7.10">He shall return no more to his house,neither shall his place know him any more.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.7.11">“Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.7.12">Am I a sea, or a sea monster,that you put a guard over me?</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.7.13">When I say, ‘My bed shall comfort me. My couch shall ease my complaint;’</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.7.14">then you scare me with dreams,and terrify me through visions:</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.7.15">so that my soul chooses strangling,death rather than my bones.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.7.16">I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.7.17">What is man, that you should magnify him,that you should set your mind on him,</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.7.18">that you should visit him every morning,and test him every moment?</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.7.19">How long will you not look away from me,nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.7.20">If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?Why have you set me as a mark for you,so that I am a burden to myself?</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.7.21">Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?For now shall I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.”</v>
		</c>
		<c id="8">
			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.8.1">Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.8.2">“How long will you speak these things?Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.8.3">Does God pervert justice?Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.8.4">If your children have sinned against him,He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.8.5">If you want to seek God diligently,make your supplication to the Almighty.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.8.6">If you were pure and upright,surely now he would awaken for you,and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.8.7">Though your beginning was small,yet your latter end would greatly increase.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.8.8">“Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.8.9">(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,because our days on earth are a shadow. )</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.8.10">Shall they not teach you, tell you,and utter words out of their heart?</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.8.11">“Can the papyrus grow up without mire?Can the rushes grow without water?</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.8.12">While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down,it withers before any other reed.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.8.13">So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man shall perish,</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.8.14">Whose confidence shall break apart,Whose trust is a spider’s web.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.8.15">He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand. He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.8.16">He is green before the sun. His shoots go out along his garden.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.8.17">His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.8.18">If he is destroyed from his place,then it shall deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.8.19">Behold, this is the joy of his way:out of the earth, others shall spring.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.8.20">“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man,neither will he uphold the evildoers.</v>

		</c>

			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.32.1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</v>
			<v id="2" bcv="JOB.32.2">Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.</v>
			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.32.3">Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.32.4">Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were elder than he.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.32.5">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.32.6">Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,“I am young, and you are very old;Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.32.7">I said, ‘Days should speak,and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.32.8">But there is a spirit in man,and the Spirit of the Almighty gives them understanding.</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.32.9">It is not the great who are wise,nor the aged who understand justice.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.32.10">Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me;I also will show my opinion.’</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.32.11">“Behold, I waited for your words,and I listened for your reasoning,while you searched out what to say.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.32.12">Yes, I gave you my full attention,but there was no one who convinced Job,or who answered his words, among you.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.32.13">Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom,God may refute him, not man;’</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.32.14">for he has not directed his words against me;neither will I answer him with your speeches.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.32.15">“They are amazed. They answer no more. They don’t have a word to say.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.32.16">Shall I wait, because they don’t speak,because they stand still, and answer no more?</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.32.17">I also will answer my part,and I also will show my opinion.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.32.18">For I am full of words. The spirit within me constrains me.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.32.19">Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent;like new wineskins it is ready to burst.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.32.20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.32.21">Please don’t let me respect any man’s person,neither will I give flattering titles to any man.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JOB.32.22">For I don’t know how to give flattering titles;or else my Maker would soon take me away.</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.33.3">My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.33.4">The Spirit of God has made me,and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.33.5">If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand up.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.33.6">Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay.</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.33.7">Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid,neither shall my pressure be heavy on you.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.33.8">“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,I have heard the voice of your words, saying,</v>

			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.33.13">Why do you strive against him,because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.33.14">For God speaks once,yes twice, though man pays no attention.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.33.15">In a dream, in a vision of the night,when deep sleep falls on men,in slumbering on the bed;</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.33.16">Then he opens the ears of men,and seals their instruction,</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.33.17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose,and hide pride from man.</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.33.18">He keeps back his soul from the pit,and his life from perishing by the sword.</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.33.19">He is chastened also with pain on his bed,with continual strife in his bones;</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.33.20">So that his life abhors bread,and his soul dainty food.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.33.21">His flesh is so consumed away, that it can’t be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JOB.33.22">Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,and his life to the destroyers.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JOB.33.23">“If there is beside him an angel,an interpreter, one among a thousand,to show to man what is right for him;</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JOB.33.24">then God is gracious to him, and says,‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,I have found a ransom.’</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JOB.33.25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JOB.33.26">He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness.</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JOB.33.27">He sings before men, and says,‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,and it didn’t profit me.</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JOB.33.28">He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life shall see the light.’</v>
			<v id="29" bcv="JOB.33.29">“Behold, God does all these things,twice, yes three times, with a man,</v>
			<v id="30" bcv="JOB.33.30">to bring back his soul from the pit,that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</v>
			<v id="31" bcv="JOB.33.31">Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak.</v>
			<v id="32" bcv="JOB.33.32">If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.34.1">Moreover Elihu answered,</v>

			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.34.4">Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.34.5">For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,God has taken away my right:</v>

			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.34.7">What man is like Job,who drinks scorn like water,</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.34.8">Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,and walks with wicked men?</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.34.9">For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothingthat he should delight himself with God.’</v>

			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.34.12">Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.34.13">Who put him in charge of the earth?or who has appointed him over the whole world?</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.34.14">If he set his heart on himself,If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.34.15">all flesh would perish together,and man would turn again to dust.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.34.16">“If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.34.17">Shall even one who hates justice govern?Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?—</v>
			<v id="18" bcv="JOB.34.18">Who says to a king, ‘Vile!’or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?</v>
			<v id="19" bcv="JOB.34.19">Who doesn’t respect the persons of princes,nor respects the rich more than the poor;for they all are the work of his hands.</v>
			<v id="20" bcv="JOB.34.20">In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand.</v>
			<v id="21" bcv="JOB.34.21">“For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings.</v>
			<v id="22" bcv="JOB.34.22">There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</v>
			<v id="23" bcv="JOB.34.23">For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,that he should go before God in judgment.</v>
			<v id="24" bcv="JOB.34.24">He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,and sets others in their place.</v>
			<v id="25" bcv="JOB.34.25">Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</v>
			<v id="26" bcv="JOB.34.26">He strikes them as wicked menin the open sight of others;</v>
			<v id="27" bcv="JOB.34.27">because they turned away from following him,and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,</v>
			<v id="28" bcv="JOB.34.28">so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted.</v>

			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.35.4">I will answer you,and your companions with you.</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.35.5">Look to the heavens, and see. See the skies, which are higher than you.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.35.6">If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.35.7">If you are righteous, what do you give him?Or what does he receive from your hand?</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.35.8">Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,and your righteousness may profit a son of man.</v>

			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.35.15">But now, because he has not visited in his anger,neither does he greatly regard arrogance.</v>

			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.36.15">He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,and opens their ear in oppression.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.36.16">Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,into a wide place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.</v>

			<v id="1" bcv="JOB.42.1">Then Job answered Yahweh,</v>

			<v id="3" bcv="JOB.42.3">You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’therefore I have uttered that which I didn’t understand,things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.</v>
			<v id="4" bcv="JOB.42.4">You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak;I will question you, and you will answer me.’</v>
			<v id="5" bcv="JOB.42.5">I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,but now my eye sees you.</v>
			<v id="6" bcv="JOB.42.6">Therefore I abhor myself,and repent in dust and ashes.”</v>
			<v id="7" bcv="JOB.42.7">It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.</v>
			<v id="8" bcv="JOB.42.8">Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”</v>
			<v id="9" bcv="JOB.42.9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.</v>
			<v id="10" bcv="JOB.42.10">Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.</v>
			<v id="11" bcv="JOB.42.11">Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of gold.</v>
			<v id="12" bcv="JOB.42.12">So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.</v>
			<v id="13" bcv="JOB.42.13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</v>
			<v id="14" bcv="JOB.42.14">He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.</v>
			<v id="15" bcv="JOB.42.15">In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</v>
			<v id="16" bcv="JOB.42.16">After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.</v>
			<v id="17" bcv="JOB.42.17">So Job died, being old and full of days.</v>
